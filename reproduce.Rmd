  Reproduce Environments Over Time
---

This section covers a variety of strategies for reproducing R environments overtime. Selecting a strategy will depend on two factors:

1. Who is responsible for managing the environment?
2. How open is the environment is? 

At first these two questions might seem similar, but separating the two uncovers common "danger zones" or "anti-strategies", which are areas on the map below that look like strategies but result in problems! This section outlines three complementary strategies and covers these anti-patterns.

## Snapshot and Restore

renv

## Shared Baselines
Discusses how to use RSPM's "frozen" repos to recreate environments, including instructions for creating point-in-time libraries.

## Validated
Discusses how to pre-emptively "freeze" folks against a point in time (using RSPM) with a link to how Docker fits in.
docker with a fixed point in time


## Anti-Patterns
