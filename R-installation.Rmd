  Installing and Managing R [In Progress]
---

This page isn't quite ready, but the focus will be installing and managing R on
Unix servers. For reproducible environments, **the most critical step is
installing R into a versioned directory!**. By doing so, your system can support
multiple versions of R and avoid unintentional R upgrades.

Instructions for building R from source and supporting multiple versions of R
are [available
here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218004217-Building-R-from-source).

This page also discusses the ways to customize R's behavior through:  

- Renviron.site  
- Rprofile.site  
- System Library  
- User Libraries  

Current details are [outlined
here](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/04/19/r-for-enterprise-understanding-r-s-startup/).
Information on the system library is elaborated on the [libraries
page](./libraries.html) as well as [this
article](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/04/19/r-for-enterprise-understanding-r-s-startup/).
