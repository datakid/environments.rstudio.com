This page is in the "use cases" section. The goal is to describe how admins can
help R users in a team operate on a shared, common library of packages to ease
collaboration. This type of shared library is usually a starting place that
evolves into a more flexible strategy of per-project libraries. This page also describes the case where admins only want to make parts of CRAN accessible.

Each strategy should be arranged as: 1-2-3 steps; longer explanation, troubleshooting.

## Strategy 1: Pinning to the Same Point in Time

## Strategy 2: Curated Repository
