  How to Pick Packages
---

This page is part of the use cases section, and describes how organizations can think about the question "what packages should we use?". The page will cover common metrics R users consider such as the package's lifecycle, test coverage, dependencies, and downloads. This page is similar to the `itdepends` discussion Jim Hester led, and is less use-case oriented.

While the page is different in scope than the rest of the website, it is a very common side question asked during discussions about environment management.

## Life Cycle
