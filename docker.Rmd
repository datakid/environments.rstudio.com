```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


Discusses how Docker fits into the rest of the topics:

- Docker does not equal reproducibility
- How should packages be managed in Docker? 
  - In the container?
  - Mounted in? 
- How to layer R into an image (our pre-built R versions)
- Future: discuss RSPM support for Linux binaries
