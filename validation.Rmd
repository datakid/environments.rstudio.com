  Using R for Validated Work
---

This page falls into the use case section and answers the question "how do I use R for validated work?". The page should be designed as checklist of things to think about if you are doing validated work, with links to other pages and external resources.

This section will cover things like:

- How recording the versions in use is important for validation
- Information on "vetting" a pacakage
- Given a set of packages, how to confirm that they run in R (unit tests, additional tests)
- References to the R in Pharma working group on validation 
- Background on how R itself is developed / validated
