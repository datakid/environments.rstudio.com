        "*pyproject.toml* is a special file that you can use to store project configuration option. It is not specific to *poetry*, other tools can also store information in *pyproject.toml* (read [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) to learn more). The `tool.poetry` section of the *pyproject.toml* is where the poetry specific meta-data is stored (<https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/>). As you will learn in the upcoming sections *pyproject.toml* will automatically be updated by *poetry* as we add and remove dependencies. \n",

        "### Manage dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "*poetry* comes with a suite of commands that you can use to manage your dependencies without ever touching *pyproject.toml* by hand. The main commands include:\n",

        "You can think of `poetry add <PACKAGE_NAME>` as being equivalent to `pip install <PACKAGE_NAME>`. One of the many benefits of using `poetry add <PACKAGE_NAME>` is that the requirement will be documented in our `pyproject.toml`, where as with *pip* the requirement is not documented in any configuration file.\n",
