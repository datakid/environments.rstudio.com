This page isn't quite ready yet, but the focus will be on the intersection of
the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate) and
[`renv`](https://github.com/rstudio/renv) packages.

For current information on environment management, see the [`reticulate::use_*`
functions](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html).

These resources describe [best
practices](https://solutions.rstudio.com/python/overview/) for using Python in
RStudio's commercial products.
